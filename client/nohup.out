[0;33mOne of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it [1mmay break at any time[0;33m.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, [1mwhich
is not maintianed anymore[0;33m. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.[0m

However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useEffect                                                 react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

To preserve the value over time, store it in a useRef Hook and keep the mutable value in the '.current' property. Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useEffect                                                 react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

  Line 552:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'props' and 'sendRouletteSignal'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
