  Line 168:6:   React Hook useEffect has missing dependencies: 'extractedValue', 'props', 'sendKeywordSignal', 'stop', and 'toggleChat'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. However, 'props' will change when *any* prop changes, so the preferred fix is to destructure the 'props' object outside of the useEffect call and refer to those specific props inside useEffect  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
